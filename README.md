I’m [Ferhat Mousavi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferhatmousavi/), a seasoned software architect and developer whose journey began in 1991. Over the years I’ve mastered a wide range of programming languages, starting with BASIC, C and Pascal and evolving into modern technologies such as **Python, C#, Java, Flutter** and more. My career has always been about pushing the boundaries of technology, constantly learning and adapting to the fast‑paced world of software development.

### Recent Python projects for the Turkish fiscal ecosystem
I recently engineered—entirely in **Python**—two nationwide, regulatory‑compliant platforms for Turkey’s Revenue Administration:

| Project | What it does | Why it matters |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **ÖKC TSM Center** | A **Trusted Service Manager** that orchestrates the entire life‑cycle of next‑generation fiscal cash registers (ÖKC); distributes secure keys & software, tracks critical events, and relays sales data to GİB with a guaranteed 99.75 % SLA. | Ensures every cash register in the country stays compliant, securely patched and continuously connected. |
| **GMÖEBYS**<br/>(Secure Mobile Payment & Electronic Document Management System, **VUK 507**) | A hardware‑agnostic, cloud‑native system that delivers end‑to‑end secure mobile payments, then generates and archives fiscal e‑documents in real time via the **Güvenli Mali Uygulama** core. | Closes tax gaps by binding every mobile sale to an auditable e‑invoice or information slip. |

Both platforms share a **multi-tier** and **micro‑service** backbone (Django/DRF + Celery, PostgreSQL, Redis), are container‑orchestrated on **Kubernetes** for zero‑downtime upgrades, integrate HSM‑backed PKI, and meet **PCI‑DSS / EMV** security standards.

### Systems & worlds I’m building
Today, I’m not just a developer; I’m a systems designer. I’m currently building a vast galaxy called **[Asha](https://asha-empire.com/)**, creating every detail from scratch. Alongside this, I’m designing and developing modular open‑source systems for the retail sector, such as **[SaleFlex](https://saleflex.app/)** and **ERP‑Flex**, which give businesses flexibility, scalability and centralized control. These systems leverage cutting‑edge technologies like cloud computing, blockchain and distributed architectures to offer future‑proof solutions for single‑ and multi‑location retail operations.

In the retail automation world, **SaleFlex.GATE** serves as a centralized hub for managing multiple POS systems, seamlessly integrating with ERP systems to provide end‑to‑end control over inventory, sales tracking and more.

My background in game development shines through in the creation of **[Asha Empire Online](https://asha-empire.com/asha-empire-online)** and **[Asha Empire: Exodus](https://asha-empire.com/asha-empire-exodus)**, both of which I single‑handedly developed in Unreal Engine—showcasing not only technical skill but also a passion for high‑quality graphics and immersive gameplay.

### End‑to‑end payment expertise
One of my core specialities is **payment systems**. My deep understanding spans EMV, ISO 8583, APACS, e‑payments, VAS and loyalty programs. I’ve architected robust, highly‑available payment solutions for retail, banking and cryptocurrency—integrating everything from fiscal ECR/POS devices to advanced terminal solutions.

My journey is about more than just coding—it’s about designing systems, creating worlds and pushing technology to new heights. Whether I’m securing millions of fiscal transactions per day, building an expansive galaxy like Asha, or mentoring new developers, I’m driven by the desire to **innovate and inspire**.
