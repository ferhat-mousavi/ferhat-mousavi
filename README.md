Hello;

I am [Ferhat Mousavi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferhatmousavi/), a seasoned software developer with a rich history in the field since 1991. My journey through the evolving landscape of technology has seen me master a plethora of programming languages, including BASIC, C, C++, Pascal, PHP, Visual Basic, C#, Java, Flutter, JavaScript, and Python. My extensive experience with Python has led me to develop a comprehensive Turkish Python training series, "[Python Komple Eğitim Serisi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NcgZe34gB0&list=PLtTs2BKyiS4C0KLmXx-3k4ho5tfW3Gs5C)," available on YouTube and [Python Komple Eğitim Seti](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-komple-egitim-seti-2023/) available on Udemy, aimed at empowering the next generation of programmers.

My expertise isn't limited to coding alone. I have a strong background in strategy development, leadership, and both project and program management. This includes overseeing product and business operations, as well as enterprise applications and software architecture. I pride myself on my ability to conduct thorough systems analysis, design, and maintenance. My project management skills are further enhanced by my adherence to PMI methodologies, enabling me to deliver full life-cycle IT solutions.

Over my 28-year career, I have been involved in numerous software projects across diverse industries such as retail, banking, IT, cryptocurrency, and blockchain. This varied experience has allowed me to specialize in technologies like Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, MongoDB, and Hazelcast. I am proficient in ANSI C/C++, Visual C++ (MFC & COM), Embedded C (on ARM Processors), Python, Visual C#.NET, Visual Basic.NET, ASP.NET MVC and WebForms, PL/SQL, AJAX, and more. Additionally, my expertise extends to a deep understanding of Fiscal ECR/POS, EMV, ISO7816, ISO14443, MDB/ICP, ISO8583, APACS 30-40, UPOS, and SMP.

I have a particular interest and extensive experience in payment systems, including e-payments VAS, loyalty programs, and EMV card & terminal solutions. My work in retail services and server-side software infrastructure has demanded high availability and robustness. Furthermore, I have been involved in developing call center infrastructures, business intelligence, machine learning (ML), predictive analytics, and various data transformation initiatives, always aiming to push the boundaries of what technology can achieve in business and beyond.

In addition to my vast experience, I am currently developing **SaleFlex**, an open-source retail sales automation system tailored to meet the needs of modern businesses. SaleFlex provides flexibility, scalability, and centralized control, making it ideal for managing both single-location and multi-location retail operations. The system is divided into two key components: **SaleFlex.**, a sales Point of Sale (POS) application that works seamlessly on both touch-screen and keyboard-operated devices, and **SaleFlex.GATE**, a centralized control hub that supports inventory and sales tracking across multiple locations. SaleFlex.GATE also integrates smoothly with ERP systems, ensuring comprehensive business management from one centralized platform. Simultaneously, I have also single-handedly developed both **'Asha Empire Online'** and **'Asha Empire: Exodus'** using the Unreal Engine. This development included everything from design to coding, showcasing my comprehensive skill set. In creating these games, I combined high-quality graphics and realistic game mechanics to produce expansive online multiplayer and single-player environments, further extending my expertise into the realm of game development.
