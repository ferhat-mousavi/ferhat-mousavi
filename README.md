I’m [Ferhat Mousavi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferhatmousavi/), a seasoned software architect and developer with a journey that began in 1991. Over the years, I’ve mastered a wide range of programming languages, starting with BASIC, C, and Pascal, and evolving into modern technologies like Python, C#, Java, Flutter, and more. My career has always been about pushing the boundaries of technology, constantly learning and adapting to the fast-paced world of software development.

Today, I’m not just a developer; I’m a systems designer. I’m currently building a vast galaxy called **[Asha](https://asha-empire.com/)**, creating every detail from scratch. Alongside this, I’m also designing and developing modular open-source systems for the retail sector, such as **[SaleFlex](https://saleflex.app/)** and **ErpFusionFlex**, which provide businesses with flexibility, scalability, and centralized control. These systems leverage cutting-edge technologies like cloud computing, blockchain, and distributed architectures to offer future-proof solutions for both single-location and multi-location retail operations.

In the retail automation world, **SaleFlex.GATE** serves as a centralized hub for managing multiple POS systems, seamlessly integrating with ERP systems to provide end-to-end control over inventory, sales tracking, and more. At the same time, my background in game development shines through in the creation of **[Asha Empire Online](https://asha-empire.com/asha-empire-online)** and **[Asha Empire: Exodus](https://asha-empire.com/asha-empire-exodus)**, both of which I single-handedly developed using Unreal Engine. These projects showcase not only my technical skills but also my passion for high-quality graphics and immersive gameplay mechanics.

One of my core areas of expertise is **end-to-end payment systems**. My deep understanding spans every aspect of payment technology, including EMV, ISO8583, APACS, e-payments, VAS, and loyalty programs. I’ve designed and implemented robust payment solutions for industries like retail, banking, and cryptocurrency, ensuring high availability and security in critical infrastructures. I specialize in integrating complex systems, from fiscal ECR/POS to advanced terminal solutions, always focused on creating reliable, scalable environments.

On top of that, I’m committed to sharing my knowledge with the world. I’ve created the *Python Komple Eğitim Serisi*, available on both [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NcgZe34gB0&list=PLtTs2BKyiS4C0KLmXx-3k4ho5tfW3Gs5C) and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-komple-egitim-seti-2023/), to guide the next generation of programmers. Teaching others and empowering them with the tools they need to succeed in the world of software development is a passion of mine.

Throughout my career, I’ve been involved in countless projects across industries, including IT, banking, retail, and blockchain, utilizing technologies like Apache Kafka, MongoDB, and Hazelcast. Whether I’m developing high-availability server infrastructures or crafting immersive game worlds, I bring a unique combination of technical depth, creativity, and leadership to every project I touch.

My journey is about more than just coding—it’s about designing systems, creating worlds, and pushing technology to new heights. Whether I'm building an expansive galaxy like Asha, designing retail automation systems, or leading end-to-end payment solutions, I’m driven by the desire to innovate and inspire.
