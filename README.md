Hello

I'm Ferhat Mousavi, I've been developing softwares since 1991. The software languages I work (or used to work) with are **BASIC**, **C**, **C++**, **Pascal**, **PHP**, **Visual Basic**, **C#**, **Java**, **Flutter**, **Java Script** and ***Python***.

I've been using Python for years. I have done or started various projects with Python. I'm trying to create a Python Turkish training series on Youtube. [Python Komple EÄŸitim Serisi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NcgZe34gB0&list=PLtTs2BKyiS4C0KLmXx-3k4ho5tfW3Gs5C)
